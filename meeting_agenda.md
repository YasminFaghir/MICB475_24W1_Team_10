### 2️⃣ Discussion: Paper Options for Project Two

#### A. Gastric Cancer Paper
- **Strengths**:
  - High relevance to disease-focused microbiome studies.
  - Potentially impactful for human health research.
- **Limitations**:
  - Dataset concerns: Issues identified in the paper's methods may lead to challenges.
- **Open Discussion**:
  - Does the dataset meet our project's objectives?
  - Are there potential workarounds for the dataset issues?

#### B. Wetland Microbiome Paper
- **Strengths**:
  - Broader environmental scope with rich datasets.
  - Flexibility to explore diverse research questions.
- **Potential Research Questions**:
  - Are there specific microbial families that dominate under certain conditions (e.g., pH, CO2 flux, nitrate levels)?
  - Can microbial families serve as indicators of environmental conditions?
  - How do latitude, longitude, and elevation affect microbial diversity?
  - Which environmental variables significantly change microbiome composition?
  - What would be the effects of microbial communities on nutrient levels in soil long-term and potential effects on crop diseases.
- **Open Discussion**:
  - Comfort level with analyzing environmental datasets.
  - Does the team feel confident about addressing these questions?

  #### Meeting Summary - Key Discussion Points
Metadata Selection & Processing:

- Only significant variables should be retained to ensure meaningful analysis.
- Diversity analysis must use categorical data.
- Continuous variables should be converted into categorical, and p-values should be used to identify significant factors.
- pH should be categorized into acidic, neutral, and basic.
- Type of land classification can be determined based on metadata content.

#### From the shared meeting notes (image), the following steps are emphasized:
- Choose metadata categories to keep, ensuring that numerical/continuous variables are converted into categorical.
- Develop a diversity analysis model to assess the significance of different variables.
- Identify the most significant category and use it to build a taxonomic model.
- Test the model using machine learning. 

#### Next Steps Before the Next Team Meeting:
- Outline research objectives for the proposal.
- Prepare the outline of the proposal.
- Prepare & finalize the dataset for analysis, ensuring that it is processed correctly.
- Describe and explain the processing of dataset (# of reads, how it was cleaned).
- Ensure all necessary files are prepared for R processing before proceeding with analysis.
