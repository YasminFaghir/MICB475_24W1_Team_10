Discussion: Paper Options for Project Two
A. Gastric Cancer Paper
Strengths:
High relevance to disease-focused microbiome studies.
Potentially impactful for human health research.
Limitations:
Dataset concerns: Issues identified in the paper's methods may lead to challenges.
Open Discussion:
Does the dataset meet our project's objectives?
Are there potential workarounds for the dataset issues?
B. Wetland Microbiome Paper
Strengths:
Broader environmental scope with rich datasets.
Flexibility to explore diverse research questions.
Potential Research Questions:
Are there specific microbial families that dominate under certain conditions (e.g., pH, CO2 flux, nitrate levels)?
Can microbial families serve as indicators of environmental conditions?
How do latitude, longitude, and elevation affect microbial diversity?
Which environmental variables significantly change microbiome composition?
